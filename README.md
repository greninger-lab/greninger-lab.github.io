# Greninger Laboratory Website Github
This is a guide for anyone who works on and updates the website in the future.

This page was written with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and base on the template [Astrofy](https://github.com/manuelernestog/astrofy) by Manuel Ernesto Garcia.

For any part not covered in the guides please refer the guides for the plugins I used:
* [Astrofy](https://github.com/manuelernestog/astrofy): _Used as template base_
* [Astro](https://astro.build/): _Html/CSS website building tool_ 
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindui.com/): _Useful components used in the website_

## Modifiying website
I recommend working on the website locally and pushing changes to github as it takes a while to compile and publish new changes online.

>Download the repo 

``` Bash
git clone https://github.com/greninger-lab/greninger-lab.github.io.git
```

>Inside your downloaded repo run

```bash
pnpm install
```

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
>This will host a local version of the website that can be viewed in your browser for instantaneous updates to edits you make to the code. Copy the link generated in your terminal and paste into your browser to see.
